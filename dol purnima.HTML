		Another Hindu festival that is celebrated with a different name in West Bengal state is “DolPurnima “. This is the Bengali version of the Holi festival. Dol Purnima is celebrated by men and women in a very dignified manner. It is done by placing the statues of Krishna and Radha on an appealingly adorned palanquin that is taken around the major streets of the village or the city.

		On the early morning of the Dol Purnima day, the students get themselves dressed up in pure white clothes or saffron-colored dress. They also wear fresh garlands of scented flowers. Everyone enjoys this occasion by immersing themselves completely in singing and dancing to the beats of musical instruments. Different types of musical instruments are used such as debris, ektara, veena, etc. The devotees swing the idols and women sing devotional songs and dance around the swing. During these activities, the men spray colored powder, abir, and colored water at them.
