		This festival happens in the period between September and October. Durga Puja is one of the major festivals of West Bengal. The massive celebration that happens during the festival is famous throughout the world. It commemorates the triumph of Good over Evil. People have this belief that Goddess Durga defeated the demon “Mahishasura” after a fierce battle that lasted for ten days. The last day or tenth day is called Vijay Dashmi.

		This festival is marked by offering prayers to the Goddess Durga, rejoicing, feasts, dance, drama, and music. On this auspicious day, people dress up in new colorful clothes. They visit puja pandals of different communities and pay reverence to the ten-armed goddess Durga. In the pandals, Goddess Saraswati, Goddess Lakshmi, Lord Ganesha, and Kartikeya are beautifully ornated and decorated. The priests do the prayers at prearranged times whereas the devotees visit pandals during the day.
