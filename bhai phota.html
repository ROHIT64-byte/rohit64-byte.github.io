		Bhai Phota is celebrated throughout West Bengal in the month of November. It is similar to the major Hindu festival “Raksha Bandhan”. This festival denotes the affection between the brother and the sister. In other words, Bhai Phota is the Bengali version of Raksha Bandhan. The rituals performed in both festivals are more or less similar.

		Here also, the sister puts “kumkum teeka” on the forehead of the brother along with some chantings. Later she offers him sweets and wishes for his long life. Brother gets the strength to stay on the righteous path. This festival relishes the tie between a sister and a brother.
